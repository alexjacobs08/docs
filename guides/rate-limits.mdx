## Rate limit tiers

TinyFn uses rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain API stability.

| Plan | Price | Requests/month | Requests/minute |
|------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 100 | 10 |
| **Starter** | $5/mo | 10,000 | 100 |
| **Pro** | $15/mo | 100,000 | 1,000 |

## Rate limit headers

Every API response includes headers showing your current usage:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Your rate limit per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the limit resets |

## Rate limit exceeded

When you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement exponential backoff">
    When you receive a 429 response, wait before retrying:

    ```python
    import time

    def make_request_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
        for attempt in range(max_retries):
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
            if response.status_code == 429:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # 1, 2, 4 seconds
                time.sleep(wait_time)
                continue
            return response
        raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cache responses">
    For endpoints with stable outputs (like validation), cache results to reduce API calls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch requests">
    Where possible, combine multiple operations into fewer requests.
  </Accordion>
