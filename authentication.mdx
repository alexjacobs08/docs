description: "How to authenticate with the TinyFn API"
---

## API Keys

All TinyFn API requests require authentication via an API key. Include your key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl "https://api.tinyfn.io/v1/generate/uuid" \
  -H "X-API-Key: tfn_live_abc123..."
```

## Getting your API key

1. [Sign up](https://tinyfn.io/#signup) for a free account
2. Your API key will be displayed on the dashboard
3. Copy and store it securely - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code, public repositories, or anywhere it could be seen by others.
</Warning>

## Key format

TinyFn API keys follow this format:

| Prefix | Environment | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `tfn_live_` | Production | `tfn_live_abc123def456...` |
| `tfn_test_` | Testing | `tfn_test_xyz789...` |

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables, not in code:

    ```bash
    export TINYFN_API_KEY="tfn_live_abc123..."
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get('TINYFN_API_KEY')
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    You can generate new API keys from your dashboard. Rotate keys periodically and if you suspect a key has been compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate keys per environment">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments.

## Error responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

Common causes:
- Missing `X-API-Key` header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Key doesn't have permission for the requested endpoint
